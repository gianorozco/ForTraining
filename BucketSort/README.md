# BucketSort

Implement a case of bucket-sort using Quicksort.
Generate 100 random numbers from the interval [0,1] and store them in 100 buckets, according to the first two digits of the number

For example 0.0017 is stored in bucket 00.
0.7503 is stored in bucket 75
0.9953 is stored in bucket 99

Run quicksort in each bucket
Output should be
1. Number of elements in each bucket
2. Total number of comparisons used in the 100 executions of Quicksort
3. Sorted array of 100 numbers
4. Average of elements in each bucket given 500 trials
